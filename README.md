## 🎓 Conferences

- Speaker at [SABS4CYBER 2019 conference.](https://www.cybsafe.com/community/blog/what-we-learned-at-sabs4cyber-2019-part-2-of-2/)
> What goes on in the boardroom?

> CybSafe’s own Isabella Manghi was next on the bill, presenting her research into cyber risk management in the boardroom. In her talk, Isabella characterised the boardroom as a “black box” of sorts – in that we know what goes into the boardroom and we know what comes out, but we don’t know how boardroom decisions are reached. Why is it, for example, boards tend to be disengaged with cyber security? And why is it boards typically underinvest in security provisions? Isabella’s research suggests boardrooms are melting pots of cognitive biases – ultimately breeding suboptimal outcomes.
